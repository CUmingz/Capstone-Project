## Introduction
In this project, I work with real-life data provided to us by Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. In this analysis process, we will discuss about the main business question below based on all demographics data of general population of Germany and customers of a mail-order company.

* What kind of Germany population groups might be represented by the customers of a mail-order company.

* What kind of Germany population groups are unlikely be the customers of a mail-order company.

* How to predict the customer conversion using the given data.

* What are the important variables that make people want to convert as a customers.

In order to answer the two questions, I applied unsupervised learning techniques on demographic and spending data for a sample of German households. I also pre-processed the data, apply dimensionality reduction techniques, and implement clustering algorithms to segment customers with the goal of optimizing customer outreach for a mail order company. Besides that, I also have access to a third dataset with attributes from targets of a mail order campaign. A supervised machine learning model was setup to predicts whether or not each individual will respond to the campaign.

By using unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, the mail-order company is able to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company.

## Datasets
The data for this project is provided by Udacity partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task. It includes general population dataset, customer segment data set, dataset of mail-out campaign with response and test dataset that needs to make predictions.

There are four datasets, all of which have identical demographics features (only part of them are different)

Two dataset for customer segmentation analysis:
* *Udacity_AZDIAS_052018.csv*: Demographics data for the general population of Germany; 891,211 persons (rows) x 366 features (columns)

* *Udacity_CUSTOMERS_052018.csv*: Demographics data for customers of a mail-order company; 191,652 persons (rows) x 369 features (columns)

Two dataset for customer conversion prediction:
* *Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TRAIN.csv*: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign; 42,982 persons (rows) x 367 (columns).

* *Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TEST.csv*: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign; 42,833 persons (rows) x 366 (columns).

In addition to the above data, there are two additional meta-data:

* *DIAS Information Levels — Attributes 2017.xlsx*: a top-level list of attributes and descriptions, organized by informational category

* *DIAS Attributes — Values 2017.xlsx*: a detailed mapping of data values for each feature in alphabetical order

A missing data summary file generated by manual work after analyzing the meta-data files above for the purpose of missing value cleaning:
* *new_feature.csv* : a missing value description for all the variables in *DIAS Attributes - Values 2017.xlsx*
